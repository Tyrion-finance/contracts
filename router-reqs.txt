I'm creating an on-chain Ethereum advertising broker using the ERC20 token TYRION.
The broker will include multiple parties collaborating on displaying ads via various media, and my platform
will be the intermediary between them. The platform will be a web app, and the TYRION token will be used to
pay for the ads. In the end the platform will be fully on chain but we're starting with limited on-chain functionality
in a smart contract called TyrionBroker. Your goal is to write this smart contract.

The following parties will be involved in the platform, and their roles & required smart contract functionalities
are described below:

Advertisers (the people who want to display ads):
    - Anyone can register as an advertiser using their web3 wallet.
    - We can also register advertisers without using wallets - so that we can register advertisers that don't have wallets.
    - Advertisers can deposit TYRION tokens into their account, those tokens are non-withdrawable and are meant to be
    used for paying publishers for displaying ads.
    - When tokens are deposited, this is how they are split:
        70% goes to the advertiser's balance
        2% is burned on the TYRION contract
        2.5% goes to referrer who referred the advertiser
        2.5% goes to contract reserves for paying referrers of the publishers
        the rest goes to the team wallet address

Publishers (the people who display ads):
    - They can display ads on their website, in their app, or in their game, in their telegram group... etc.
    - A publisher must have a web3 wallet (such as metamask) and they have to register in the contract by themselves.
    - A publisher should have a withdrawable balance which they can withdraw to their wallet.
    - That balance will be increased by our server, after they've properly displayed an ad and we verified it.
    - The withdrawable balances of all publishers should obviously not exceed the total balance of what advertisers
    deposited to the contract.
    - When a publisher withdraws their balance, if they have a referrer, that referrer balance should receive 2.5% of the
    initially deposited amount corresponding to the amount being withdrawn, taken from the contract reserves for
    referrers.

Referrer:
    - Anybody can become a referrer and send people to the platform.
    - They should register in our smart contract to become a referrer.
    - Our server should then receive their referrer ID and use it to generate a referral link for them.
    - When either an advertiser or publisher registers using their referral link, it should be marked in the contract.
    - The referrer has a withdrawable balance which they can withdraw to their wallet, and it's updated when publishers
    withdraw their balance or when advertisers deposit tokens.

It should be possible to upgrade contract functionality, in a way that doesn't affect the existing data, and friendly
to the community so they're not afraid of malicious activities.

All contracts should emit events which allow for easy browsing through publishers, advertisers, referrers and
their transactions.
